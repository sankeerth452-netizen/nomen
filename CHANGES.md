# Changes since Nitin's original

Nitin's version is tagged `nitin-original` (branch `claude/great-bell-lfbirc`, d4a10d5). Everything below is local work on top of it.

## P0: accuracy fixes (29 Oct 2026)

Each gap was first reproduced against the original code, then fixed and covered by tests (`tests/accuracy.test.ts`, plus new cases in `tests/pipeline.test.ts` and `tests/validate.test.ts`). 82 tests pass (61 original + 21 new).

| Gap in the original | What happened | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opposite words passed the grounding check | Words matched on their first 4 letters, so the AI's "strapless" was kept for a buyer's "strappy", "sleeveless" for "puff sleeve", "longline" for "long sleeve" | `wordStem` folds real word forms (ruching/ruched/ruche, pleats/pleated) and never folds a "-less" word into its opposite. Those AI facts are dropped and shown as ignored. The buyer's own opposite details ("strapless" + "strappy") are flagged as a conflict |
| Buyer terms weren't grounded | Every AI-supplied `buyer_terms` word became an allowed title word, unchecked | `buyer_terms` go through the same grounding check |
| "Mesh sleeves" became a mesh dress | Extraction split it into material: mesh + feature: sleeve, so "Black Mesh Midi Dress" passed, and "black mesh midi dress" was offered as the primary keyword | A colour or material written only before a garment part stays with it as a feature ("mesh sleeve", "lace trim", "white collar"). The validator rejects titles that use it on its own, and scoring excludes keywords that do. The extraction and recommend prompts say the same (now `extract-v2`, `recommend-v3`) |
| "Ruched" was rejected for a buyer's "ruching" | The validator only allowed exact or plural forms, which cost a repair call or failed. Keyword scoring threw out "ruched midi dress" (1,000/mo), and SERP patterns told Claude not to use "ruched" | Validator, keyword scoring and SERP patterns all match by word form |
| Length limit was only a warning | A 76-character title passed with a 70 maximum | Over-length is an error: one repair call, then the generation fails safely. Over-length alternatives are dropped with a note. The mock recommender trims trailing details to fit |
| Weak input still produced a title | "nice dress" gave the title "Dress" at Medium confidence | No detail beyond the product type (praise like "nice", "cute" doesn't count) stops with a plain request for a colour, material, fit, length or feature, before any paid search or recommendation call |

Example (mock mode, "black dress with ruching, midi length, mesh sleeves"):
- before: **Black Mesh Midi Dress**, primary keyword "black mesh midi dress" (50/mo), and "ruching" was lost
- after: **Black Mesh Sleeve Ruched Midi Dress**, primary keyword "black midi dress" (8,100/mo), with "material was not supplied" (true: only the sleeves are mesh)

Not yet verified against the live Claude and DataForSEO APIs (no keys locally); the real prompts changed, so the first live run should be checked by hand.
